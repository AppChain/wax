## Wax Records

Records are a feature of Wax aimed to simplify the configuration of sites that
host many maps. They translate the configuration of any mapping API into 
logic-free [JSON](http://json.org/), where it can be stored in a database and 
easily modified by other code.
</p>
<div class='section'>
<pre class='sh_javascript'>
new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('gmap'), {
  center: new google.maps.LatLng(0, 0),
  zoom: 2,
  mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP
});

// The above code is equivalent to

wax.Record({ 'wax':
  ['@new google.maps.Map',
    ['@call document.getElementById', 'gmap'],
    {
      center: ['@new google.maps.LatLng', 0, 0],
      zoom: 2,
      mapTypeId: ['@literal google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP']
    }
  ]
});
</pre>
<p class='md'>
Records aim to be a very close translation from the actual Javascript. 
You'll notice that the Javascript keyword `new` is represented by `@new`, 
and the same with calling functions, using literal functions, etc.

* Records are not written for variable-heavy code. A great chaining interface,
with `@group`, `@inject`, and `@chain` is available for libraries that 
are written in a chainable fashion, like Modest Maps and Polymaps.
* Records are mainly written for code that will be 'done' when the Record 
stops spinning. Although `wax.Record` returns the last object it was playing
around with (most often the map object), this is more a convenience than a core 
API guarantee.

## Mapping Libraries

Wax supports [Modest Maps] [1], [OpenLayers] [2], and [Google Maps] [3] APIs
with custom map controls - the ability to interact with tooltips and links,
a legend to illustrate map data, and other various utilities.

Modest Maps is the recommended library for use with Wax. Being more compact 
than OpenLayers, faster on older browsers than Polymaps, and more flexible 
than the Google Maps makes it a good choice for custom mapping applications.
The library was originally developed by Tom Carden and Mike Migurski of
[Stamen](http://stamen.com/) as a port of [ActionScript and Python code](http://modestmaps.com/).

### Modest Maps and Layering

Modest Maps natively supports a single map layer at a time, unlike OpenLayers, 
which has a flexible baselayer/overlay system. Currently we're working on 
compositing layers server-side rather than supporting multiple layers in the 
browser, because this could give a much higher level of performance.

The main reason that [Polymaps](http://polymaps.org/) is not recommended for
mainstream usage is its lack of support for Internet Explorer. Modest Maps,
OpenLayers, and Google Maps all have solid support for Internet Explorer 7
and higher.

## Wax's Tricks

Wax provides a set of map controls for Modest Maps that make common map
tricks easier to do.

### Fullscreen

The fullscreen control adds a link to the map that assigns a 
fullscreen class to the map, which makes it fill the page.

### Zoomer

The Zoomer control is a stripped-down version of zoom controls, offering just
zoom in & out buttons.

### Legend

The legend control pulls legend information from an interactive layer and 
displays it on the map.

### Interaction

The interaction control adds quite a bit of logic to the map, adding 
interactivity - mouse hovers and clicks - to layers that support it, like those
made with [TileMill](http://tilemill.com/) and the interactive 
[UTFGrid section] [1]
of the [MBTiles spec] [2].
